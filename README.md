## :pencil2:About the Project

"Little Esty Shop Bulk Discount" is a solo project that requires a student to add to a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage bulk discounts for their inventory of items. The learning goals for this project included practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships, utilizing advanced routing techniques, utilizing advanced Active Record techniques to perform complex database queries, and to practice consuming a public API.
